**Ratio BY 2**

First find the maximum(a) and minimum(b) of the given numbers

Then run a loop infinitely upto where  a should be greater are equal to 2 * b

In each  iteration  decrement the value of b and increment the value of the count

Now print the value of count .Which is the required task .

**Time Complexity :**

O(N)

**Space Complexity :**
